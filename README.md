# ReignTillSalvation
This project was made by two students from Telecom Sudparis: Cyprien Lambert and Richard Nguyen,
as part of a school C++ game development project.

Gameplay:
The player will have to keep a population alive in this game. The population is composed of many individuals who are attracted or repelled by elements on the map. However, if you let them go as they wish, the dangers that will appear will kill them. So save them by making rules that compel them to be attracted or repelled to the element of your choice, so as to control their movement.
